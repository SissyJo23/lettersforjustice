   🗝️ The Lighthouse Keeper’s Hope
 </h2>
 <p><em>Sent: 5/21/2025</em></p>
 
 <p><strong>A bond endures where justice once was lost,</strong></p>
 <p>He asked the night from his home, soft and low:<br>
 The windows open to the breeze's flow,<br>
 The scent of rain on pavement, fresh and clear,<br>
 A world rebuilt, yet haunted by the near.</p>
 
 <p><em>"Is this how it ends—I'm free, and she...?"</em></p>
 
 <p>From her lighthouse, gazing out with care,<br>
 She stands where salt-wind tangles in her hair.<br>
 Orange blossoms scent the cool night air,<br>
 Their sweetness drifting, mingling with despair.</p>
 
 <p>Below, the trains wail softly as they leave,<br>
 A melancholy music, hearts to grieve.</p>
 
 <p>She whispers to the silence, lost in thought,<br>
 Her voice a fragile echo, barely caught:<br>
 <em>"He's home, but is the fight for him really...?"</em></p>
 
 <p>The fight for justice won—so now, what's left?<br>
 Is it for him, or just the love they kept?</p>
 
 <p>Did they know the other loved, or was it hidden—<br>
 A secret whispered, lost beneath the battle,<br>
 A spark unspoken, waiting in the middle?</p>
 
 <p>Or did each heart, in messages and sighs,<br>
 Guess at the truth, yet fear to realize?</p>
 
 <p>So now she wonders, as the night drifts by,<br>
 If love was ever more than hope's reply.</p>
 
 <p>Their questions hang, unanswered, in the sky.</p>
 
 <p>Yet in their hearts, the messages remain,<br>
 Each text and chat, alive with joy and pain.<br>
 A love unnamed, a hope that will sustain,<br>
 Each word a bridge across the miles of rain.</p>
 
 <p>Though never met, their voices softly blend,<br>
 A tale of whispers carried by the frost.<br>
 A whispered story with no certain end.</p>
