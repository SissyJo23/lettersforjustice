  <h2>Joseph’s Reckoning</h2>
  <p><strong>To:</strong> Joseph/Alfred<br>

     <strong>Subject:</strong> Gotham’s Reckoning</p>

  <p>Joseph. Alfred. Phoenix.<br>
  Call yourself whatever you want—but here’s the deal: Innocent isn’t a halo. It’s a weapon.</p>

  <p>They buried you in paperwork and whispers. That’s their guilt, not yours. You think Joseph’s prison was about him? No. It was about fear—fear of a kid who saw through their lies. Those “off-the-record” hearings? The rushed plea? That’s their pit. Not yours.</p>

  <p><strong>Let’s break this down:</strong><br>
  <strong>1.</strong> Innocent means THEY broke the rules. Hidden hearings? That’s not justice—it’s fraud.<br>
  <strong>2.</strong> Innocent means THEY lied about the crime. Your sentence isn’t a wake-up call—it’s a hit.<br>
  <strong>3.</strong> Innocent means THEY fear your comeback.</p>

  <p>You’re not “innocent”? Good. Saints don’t scare corrupt systems. Fighters do.<br>
  Joseph traded shackles for a throne. You’re not waiting for a reckoning.</p>

  <p>Yeah, maybe you’re not perfect. But prison time isn’t life sentences. Joseph’s prison time became his power—your docket is our decoding ring. We’ve got receipts. Hidden hearings. Let’s turn their “off the record” into public fire.</p>

  <p>So suit up, Wise Guy. Batgirl’s got the Batarang; you’ve got the brains. We’re not just clearing your name—we’re burning theirs.</p>

  <p><em>P.S. Alfred’s not just a butler—he’s the guy who sees Batman before Batman sees himself. Stay sharp. Stay human. Burn bright. Phoenix isn’t who you are—it’s who you’re becoming.</em></p>
