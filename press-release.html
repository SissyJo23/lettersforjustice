  <h1>#JoeysLaw: Advocates Demand Justice for Joseph Lagerman</h1>

  <p>A new advocacy campaign, <strong>#JoeysLaw</strong>, has launched to spotlight the case of Joseph Lagerman, who is currently serving a <strong>32.5-year sentence</strong> in Wisconsin for charges stemming from an incident in 2018. Supporters, led by Christy, who has been corresponding and building a legal advocacy network on Joseph’s behalf, aim to bring public attention to what they argue are serious judicial oversights and sentencing disparities.</p>

  <p>According to the campaign, key issues in Joseph’s case include <strong>misrepresented plea agreements</strong>, the <strong>absence of critical witness testimony</strong>, and <strong>combined charges</strong> that led to a sentence far exceeding what some say is proportionate. <strong>#JoeysLaw</strong> highlights these alleged injustices, presenting detailed case documentation and personal narratives from Joseph and Christy.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Joseph’s story is more than a legal case—it’s about truth, fairness, and human dignity,” said Christy. “Through #JoeysLaw, we want to ensure his voice is heard, his story is told, and that justice is pursued.”
