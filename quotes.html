   <h1>Joseph’s Words</h1>
   <p>His voice, his truth. These are Joseph Lagerman’s own reflections on his plea, his sentence, and his fight for justice.</p>

   <h2>🗣️ On the Plea</h2>
   <blockquote>
     “The ‘plea’ I took was really just them getting me to cop out and avoid trial—on charges they knew probably wouldn’t stick.
     They amended my first-degree intentional attempted homicide charge—non-stick but daunting—into two separate first-degree recklessly endangering safeties.
     One was already tacked on with the original charge, along with a deadly weapon modifier.
     They didn’t put any numbers on it, but the exposure—the sales pitch—was reduced by half if I accepted the plea.
     I think they covered all their bases to make sure I took the plea ‘knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.’
     They went through the whole checklist: no meds in the last day, yes this, yes that...
     But I was definitely a little ill-informed, and maybe a little misled by my public defender.
     They ended up giving me two and a half years under the max—so legally, not excessive.
     But that doesn’t make it just.”

   <h2>🧠 On Mental Health</h2>
   <blockquote>
     “I wasn’t trying to hurt anyone. I was scared. I was spiraling.  
     They saw a weapon and ignored the panic.  
     They saw a charge and ignored the diagnosis.”

   <h2>📣 On Justice</h2>
   <blockquote>
     “I want to ensure my voice is heard, my story is told, and that justice is pursued.”
