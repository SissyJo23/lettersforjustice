    <h2 class="section-title">The Story They Tried to Bury</h2>

      <p>
        The "Plea" I took was really just them getting me to cop out, and avoiding trial and charges they knew probably wouldn't stick...
        <br><br>
        I was working on getting the place together‚Äîwe had just moved in. On January 18, 2018, MT and I got into a heated argument. Alcohol, drugs, and rage blurred reality. She walked outside in the freezing Wisconsin cold, barely dressed, looking for me. I locked the door. She threatened to break the window. I retreated to the bathroom for more coke.
        <br><br>
        When I opened the door again, she was talking to two people on the porch. I pulled my gun and told them to get away from the house. They left. We calmed down. But they had called the police.
        <br><br>
        Next thing I knew, we were surrounded. I told MT not to open the door. She did. I panicked. I fired two shots‚Äînot at anyone, just through a wall, crying and shaking, hoping they'd kill me. They didn‚Äôt.
        <br><br>
        The arresting officers dragged me out. I asked about my dog. I said I was glad no one was hurt.
        <br><br>
        But they made me the symbol of something bigger‚Äîthree officers had died that year, and they needed an example. At sentencing, the DA acted like it was personal. Officers testified about trauma. The judge compared me to Darth Vader. He said, ‚ÄúYeah people are going to commit suicide, but why involve somebody else?‚Äù And gave me a sentence that ignored everything that led up to that moment.
        <br><br>
        I‚Äôm not asking to be called innocent. I‚Äôm asking for truth. I‚Äôm asking for the whole story to be seen, not just the parts that justify burying me alive.
        <br><br>
        Still fighting. Scars and all.
