  <h2>The Full Story They Tried to Bury — Joseph’s Words</h2>

  <button id="read-more-btn" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="full-story-content">
    Read Full Story
  </button>

  <div id="full-story-content" tabindex="0" aria-hidden="true" style="display: none;">
    <p>The “plea” I took was really just a way for them to get me to cop out and avoid trial—a trial they probably knew they couldn’t win. They amended my original first-degree intentional attempted homicide charge (daunting, but shaky) into two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment. One count was already tacked on, plus a deadly weapon modifier. The exposure (their sales pitch) was supposedly cut in half if I accepted the plea.</p>

    <p>They made sure I “knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently” took the plea by going through the standard questionnaire in court, but I was a little misled by my public defender. Honestly, I was ill-informed. They gave me two and a half years under the maximum, so legally not excessive—but that doesn’t mean it was fair.</p>

    <p>McGuire, the prosecutor for the state? Didn’t ring a bell. The real DA on my felony case was Denis John Stingl, who made an unofficial offer of “five in, five out.” When I asked my lawyer to get it in writing, he said the DA had mixed up the cases, so no deal.</p>

    <p>The plea was presented to me as-is by my attorney and in court with an initialed questionnaire clarified on record. I wasn’t at any off-the-record meetings and didn’t hear about any, except for one mishap. All I have are transcripts, police reports, and official stuff.</p>

    <p>I’m not innocent, though. Not in the saintly sense. I messed up. But this fight isn’t about perfection—it’s about fairness. I needed a wake-up call, and this system gave me one in the worst way possible.</p>

    <h3>What Happened That Day</h3>
    <p>January 18, 2018: I was arguing with my then-girlfriend, Mekayla Terrell. Found a half-empty bottle of cheap Paul Masson in a backpack along with condoms and beach towels—ironic, right? We drank it. I also kept doing “kokhane” (a drug that somehow keeps the drunkness at bay). The argument escalated from yelling to breaking stuff in the house we’d just moved into.</p>

    <p>At one point, Mekayla walked outside wearing just leggings and a bra in freezing January Wisconsin, raving about breaking the window. I locked the door behind me and went to the bathroom to do more kokhane.</p>

    <p>Then I saw her outside with two figures coming up. I pulled my gun, told them to get away and told Mekayla to come back inside. They left, she came in, and the argument mostly died down.</p>

    <h3>The Incident Details</h3>
    <p>For some dumb luck, I had three slugs in my gun but dropped one on the porch, so only two shots fired. They hit the door jamb about four feet up, a few inches apart. The cops came in through the kitchen side, saw I was empty and crying, and dragged me away.</p>

    <p>In the squad car, I asked if they hurt my dog and said I was glad no one was hurt.</p>

    <p>Things didn’t help when I didn’t lawyer up right away. That year and a half in county was rough: three officers died in the line of duty for the first time since the ’80s.</p>

    <p>Also, a month before this incident, I punched a cop during a fit in a gas station. I was assaulting the clerk and snorted some kokhane off the register. When cops arrived, I hit one officer. That got me four misdemeanors and a few days in jail, even though I was unemployed and needed time to get my life straight.</p>

    <p>At sentencing, the officers gave dramatic testimony and requested I be incarcerated for their careers’ length. The judge said, “Granted.”</p>

    <h3>The Courtroom and Sentencing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No officers testified between plea and sentencing—only during preliminary and sentencing hearings.</li>
      <li>The judge emphasized setting an example due to the three fallen officers and mentioned a previous case where he denied leniency.</li>
      <li>The arresting officers were present and asked for the maximum sentence.</li>
      <li>The judge had Yoda and Darth Vader bobbleheads—he said, “People are going to commit suicide, but why involve somebody else?” It was chilling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Joseph’s Takeaway</h3>
    <p>This wasn’t just about one night or one mistake. It was a system burying me with paperwork, whispers, and silence. The plea was a trap. The hearings I wasn’t at were shadows. The sentence wasn’t justice—it was punishment.</p>

    <p>But I’m still here. Still fighting. Scars and all.</p>

    <h3>Key Facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Joseph Lagerman received a disproportionately harsh sentence.</li>
      <li>Inconsistencies in the legal process were ignored during trial.</li>
      <li>No violent history or prior felony record.</li>
      <li>Similar cases resulted in far lesser sentences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Case at a Glance</h2>
    <p>
      Joseph Lagerman was sentenced to an unusually long term under circumstances that have raised serious legal and ethical questions. Advocacy groups, family, and legal experts have called for a re-examination of the trial and sentencing.
    </p>
    <p>
      His case reflects broader issues within the justice system — where sentencing disparities, prosecutorial discretion, and socioeconomic background may unjustly influence outcomes.

    <div class="story-content" id="storyContent">
      <p>
        Joseph Lagerman, a first-time offender with no violent past, was charged under a statute typically reserved for repeat, high-level offenses. During the trial, crucial mitigating evidence was not fully considered. Witness statements were contradictory, and yet no benefit of doubt was extended to Joseph.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sentencing guidelines suggest a maximum far lower than what was ultimately imposed. Comparisons with similar cases reveal a stark inconsistency in punishment. Multiple legal analysts have suggested that this may be a case of prosecutorial overreach combined with insufficient defense resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Family members continue to campaign tirelessly for justice. With your help — through letters, awareness, and support — a push for a fair resentencing or review is gaining momentum.
