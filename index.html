    <h2>The Story They Tried to Bury</h2>
    <p>Joseph Lagerman is serving 32.5 years for an incident where nobody was harmed, and there was never any intent to harm. His story reveals a justice system stacked against him.</p>
    <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleStory()">Read Full Story</button>
    <div id="storyContent">
The ‘plea’ I took was really just me standing there, cornered in a courtroom, being told it was my only option. I never got to tell my full side, and the story that’s been spread about me is not the truth. That day in 2018 has haunted me every second since, and I want you to know exactly what really happened.

It started with me already in a bad state. I was using, I wasn’t stable, and I was not myself. The gun I had went off—yes—but it was never my intent to harm anyone. Nobody was hurt. Not a single person. It was chaos, confusion, and fear. But harm? No. That wasn’t in my heart, not even for a second.

When the gun fired, I panicked and didn’t care what happened to me at that point. I was spiraling, not thinking, not in control of myself. It wasn’t bravery or defiance—it was pure panic and a kind of desperation that makes your chest tight just remembering it.

The courtroom made it worse. Witnesses never showed up, and yet the charges stacked and stacked. Everything from my past, even things that weren’t supposed to count, got folded into this one case. They combined it all and treated me as though I was being sentenced for everything I had ever done in my entire life. They didn’t see me as a man—they saw me as a case number, a file to close.

I wasn’t violent. I wasn’t trying to fight anyone. I was trapped in my own head, and they turned that into 32 and a half years. Thirty-two and a half years for something that usually brings 5–7. How is that justice? How is that anything but burying me alive?

What makes it worse is how much of it was handled off the record, in ways I didn’t even know about until later. Plea deals that weren’t really deals. Hearings I didn’t even know happened. Misrepresentations that never should’ve stood in court. And once it was sealed in, that was it. Like the truth didn’t even matter anymore.

The truth is—I was a man in pain. I was someone struggling with mental health, addiction, and fear. I was someone who made mistakes, yes, but not someone who deserved to be thrown away for life. I never intended harm. I never hurt anyone. And yet, here I am, locked away as if I did the worst thing imaginable.

I replay it in my mind constantly. The look of the room. The way the gun felt heavy in my hand. The sound of the shot. The silence afterward. And the way the system twisted it all into something it wasn’t. That’s the punishment I carry every day, even before the prison walls close in.

Still, I’m fighting. Still, I’m speaking. Because this isn’t just about me—it’s about how many others have been buried by a system that doesn’t care about truth, only about winning cases. If my voice can dig even a little of that truth back up, then maybe there’s hope—not just for me, but for anyone who’s ever been silenced.

Still fighting. Scars and all.
