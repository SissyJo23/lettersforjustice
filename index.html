      Joseph Lagerman is serving 32.5 years for a crime that harmed no one. He never had a trial. Never faced his accusers. And the courtroom mocked him with bobbleheads and bias. We're not asking for favors. We're demanding justice.

    <h2>Deep Dive: The Truth They Buried</h2>
    <p>Joseph Lagerman never got a trial. Not one civilian witness ever showed up. No opportunity to cross-examine. No second chances. The only thing the system gave him was time—32.5 years of it.</p>
    <p>He was sentenced not just for what happened that day, but for everything the state could dig up and lump in. There were no other open cases. No violent record. But you wouldn’t know that by the way they came down on him.</p>
    <p>In the courtroom—where justice should live—Joseph stood before a judge who never looked him in the eyes. The same judge who displayed bobbleheads of Yoda and Darth Vader during sentencing. The same judge who smirked and said, “I’m not buying what you’re selling.”</p>
    <p>Joseph apologized to the officers who arrested him. He was not resisting. He was crying. He was done. The dispatch audio confirms it: “Shots fired... at the ground... suspect in custody.” A video shows him being pulled from a bathroom, not fighting, not armed. But none of that mattered in court.</p>
    <p>The officers who asked for a maximum sentence later posed smiling in Joseph’s living room for a post-arrest photo — arms around each other, standing proudly, untouched. That photo was never shown in court. Neither was the video. Neither was the truth.</p>
    <p>Joseph’s story isn’t rare. But it is buried. We’re digging it back up — and you're holding the shovel.</p>
