      The "Plea" I took was really just them getting me to cop out, and avoiding trial and charges they knew probably wouldn't stick. They really just amended my first degree intentional attempted homicide charge (non-stick but daunting) into two separate first degree recklessly endangering safeties. (One was already tacked on with the original charge along with a use of deadly weapon modifier.) They didn't put any numbers on it but the exposure (the sales pitch for me) reduced by half with me accepting a plea.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I think they covered all their bases as far as me taking the plea "knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently" because they definitely went through the whole questionnaire of me knowing what I was doing, nope no medication in the last day, yes this, yes that... for sure was a little ill informed and maybe a little misled by my public defender... they ended up giving me two and a half years under the max so legally not excessive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Honestly, your words and passion filled my eyes with tears. Thank you for the positivity you share, and for believing in me. I DEFINITELY don't want to discourage you from encouraging me (it's like aloe vera on burned skin) but I'm not innocent. You're right about the fight and grit. At one point I was just so ungrateful I needed some kind of wake up call. Unfortunately it came in this form...
    </p>

    <p><strong>I wanted to ask you a few things that have been on my mind as I look through your case:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>McGuire for the State: What was he like? Did you get to speak to him at all? Did you notice if anyone’s behavior changed once he started working on your case?</li>
      <li>Plea: You mentioned the plea was written down—was it the version you were shown, or just what the State put together? Did you get to read it fully before you agreed?</li>
      <li>Off the Record: Were you ever present at any of the “off the record” proceedings? Or did you ever find out what was discussed in those sessions when you weren’t there?</li>
      <li>Details: Is there anything else—letters, emails, notes, or anything not in the official docket—that might help me understand more about what happened?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      McGuire didn't ring a bell at all so I checked my papers and he sat in on two reschedulings for my misdemeanor case. A man named Denis John Stingl was the DA on my felony case. The idiot made an unofficial offer of five in five out and when I told my lawyer to get it in writing, he said he had his cases mixed up (and the severity of mine), so no deal. The plea was presented to me the same from my attorney and in court with an initialed questionnaire that was clarified on the record. It was to amend the charges like I said and to leave both sides free to argue a sentence... I'm pretty sure I wasn't at any off-the-record meetings and didn't hear of any proceedings except that mishap... and all I have is the transcripts and official police reports and stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think I waited quite a while before telling my attorney to put the speedy trial in but yes I was aware. I can't say for sure if I knew about any of the ones that I wasn't there for. I know for a while my misdemeanor stuff was being postponed because of my felony charges. So maybe that's what some of them were for. Or maybe for a joinder motion. My attorney told me it would be better to do that. But there's some mention of it in my papers. I'm out! Big day tomorrow!! Goodnight! YeeHaw!!
    </p>

    <p>
      No fair you know my middle name! I would like to know hours sometime.... January eighteenth, twenty eighteen: spent arguing with my former girlfriend (MT it says in the papers) Mekayla Terrell. I found a half filled huge bottle of Paul Masson (cheap brown liquor) in a backpack left by one of my buddies in a backpack filled with condoms and beach towels (ironically not source of argument). We proceeded to drink it (I also continued to do kokhane which somehow magically keeps your drunkenness at bay even if you're not a big drinker). Escalated from a shouting match to a real-life whack a mole game. We started taking turns breaking everything in the house, which wasn't much we just moved in and I was working on getting the place together. Anyways at one point I realize how drunk MT really is when she walks right past me with some bludgeonable object and says out loud, "Where you at bitch?" Then walks outside on the porch looking for me... mind you it’s January in Wisconsin; definitely freezing, she's got on leggings and a bra. I close the door and lock it and she goes to the picture window raving about breaking it. I decide now that it's kinda quiet go to the bathroom to do more Kohkane... a minute or two later I open the front door and see MT with two figures walking up to her and thought for some reason it was a good idea to pull my gun and tell these people to get away from my house and MT to come back inside. They left she came back in. Our argument was mostly dead. But these people called the police telling them what happened but also that I had dragged MT in the house and some crazy stuff. Anyways a little while goes by and I look out of the window and see a cop then many cops surrounding the house. MT tells me so, I tell her whatever you do don't open up give me a minute, she says I'm letting them in and I run to the bathroom. I panic but at the same time had my mind made up that I was going to get them to kill me. I reached my arm out blindly fired the two rounds I had.
    </p>

    <p>
      So for some stupid/blessed reason I had three slugs in my gun one of which I accidentally chambered and dropped to the floor when I went out on front porch. That leaves two... so directly in front of the bathroom there is a wall the skinny way that divides the kitchen and another bedroom either of which you can go through to get to the front door. It's one of those the other bedroom has two doors. The shots struck the door jamb about 4 feet up from the floor a few inches apart. See for you to get where I was you had to go through the kitchen because the other way was blocked by a couch directly in front of me, a wall, kitchen sink, and stove. Forty five degrees to the side the cops were coming in and seen that I was empty and crying... and they dragged me away... in the squad I asked if they hurt my dog and other semi insensitive stuff but expressed being glad that I hadn't hurt anyone. I know it didn't help my case that I didn't lawyer up right away, there were three people that passed that year and a half that I was in county, in the line of duty for the first time since the eighties... also I cannot neglect the fact that a month or so before this incident I punched a cop while having a fit in a gas station. In said fit I was assaulting the clerk and snorted some Kokhane from on the register when the authorities came and decided to put their guns away and pull out tasers—it's just some crazy guy not a robber bam I hit one... they gave me four misdemeanors and about three days in jail even though I was unemployed and would have benefitted greatly from the six months of thinking time they eventually ran consecutive to the bigger sentence.
    </p>

    <p>
      In sentencing the involved officers came in with their best long faces and traumatic stories complete with dramatic pauses and a request that I be incarcerated for the length of their careers and the judge said granted... oh yeah they put some words in my mouth in an unofficial interview where I apparently admitted guilt to attempted murder.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Summary of key courtroom facts:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>No officers testified between plea and sentencing</li>
      <li>No officers officially spoke besides preliminary and at sentencing</li>
      <li>Judge talked a lot about the example he had to set because of three fallen officers and mentioned another case where the officer was asking for leniency and he disregarded</li>
      <li>The arresting officers were present at sentencing hearing asking for maximum sentence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I remember the judge had bobbleheads on his desk; Yoda on his and the D.A.'s side and Darth Vader on the defendant's side. He said "yeah people are going to commit suicide, but why involve somebody else" I mean he's right about that.

  <h3>Key Facts</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No prior felony convictions at the time of arrest or sentencing</li>
    <li>No one was injured—not even a scratch reported</li>
    <li>No civilian witnesses testified in any hearing or trial</li>
    <li>Sentenced to 32.5 years, just below the statutory maximum</li>
    <li>Judge displayed visible bias, including inappropriate courtroom decor and commentary</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Story They Tried to Bury</h2>
  <p>Joseph Lagerman never got a trial. Not one civilian witness ever showed up. No opportunity to cross-examine. No second chances. The only thing the system gave him was time—32.5 years of it.</p>
  <p>He was sentenced not just for what happened that day, but for everything the state could dig up and lump in. There were no other open cases. No violent record. But you wouldn’t know that by the way they came down on him.</p>
  <p>And in the courtroom—where justice should live—Joseph stood in front of a judge who never looked him in the eyes. The same judge who displayed bobbleheads of Yoda and Darth Vader during sentencing...</p>
  <p>But Joey’s not done. And neither are we. Truth doesn’t die in silence—it rises with every voice that dares to speak it.</p>
