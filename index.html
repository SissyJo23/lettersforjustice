    <h2>The Story They Tried to Bury</h2>
    <p>Joseph Lagerman never got a trial. Not one civilian witness ever showed up. No opportunity to cross-examine. No second chances. The only thing the system gave him was time ‚Äî 32.5 years of it.</p>
    <p>What he got instead was a sentence for everything the state could dig up and pin on him ‚Äî even when it wasn‚Äôt part of the case. No open cases. No violent record. Just the weight of a system that decided who he was before ever hearing him speak.</p>
    <p>They called him a felon ‚Äî but he wasn‚Äôt. Not until this case. The charges were enhanced as if he‚Äôd already been convicted, stacking penalties for a label that hadn‚Äôt been proven yet. Due process vanished like smoke.</p>
    <p>That day, Joseph fired two rounds ‚Äî into the floor. He never aimed at anyone. No one was injured. You can hear it in dispatch: <em>‚Äúshots fired ‚Äî at the ground ‚Äî suspect in custody.‚Äù</em> You can see it on video: he‚Äôs dragged from the bathroom, sobbing, unresisting. A man in crisis. Not a threat.</p>
    <p>The judge who sentenced him? He never looked Joseph in the eyes. Just stared straight ahead while Yoda and Darth Vader bobbleheads stared back from the bench. That same judge would later say he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt buying what Joseph was selling.‚Äù</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the arresting officers posed for a smiling photo in Joseph‚Äôs living room. Days later, they testified they couldn‚Äôt sleep at night ‚Äî haunted by Joseph‚Äôs face. The same face they joked about while standing next to the bullet holes in his floor.</p>
    <p>There were no eyewitnesses. No trial. No civilian came forward to say what happened. The audio evidence was ignored. And his public defenders never fought like they should have ‚Äî one of them even had a prior connection to his girlfriend‚Äôs case.</p>
    <p>Joseph‚Äôs life shattered. Theirs didn‚Äôt even crack.</p>
    <p>But Joey‚Äôs not done. And neither are we. Truth doesn‚Äôt die in silence ‚Äî it rises with every voice that dares to speak it. And now, you‚Äôre here. You‚Äôve heard the beginning. Help us write the ending.</p>
