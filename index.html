    <h3>Key Facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Joseph Lagerman received a disproportionately harsh sentence.</li>
      <li>Inconsistencies in the legal process were ignored during trial.</li>
      <li>No violent history or prior felony record.</li>
      <li>Similar cases resulted in far lesser sentences.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="deep-dive">
    <h2>The Case at a Glance</h2>
    <p>Joseph Lagerman was sentenced to an unusually long term under circumstances that have raised serious legal and ethical questions. Advocacy groups, family, and legal experts have called for a re-examination of the trial and sentencing.</p>
    <p>His case reflects broader issues within the justice system ‚Äî where sentencing disparities, prosecutorial discretion, and socioeconomic background may unjustly influence outcomes.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="why-matters">
    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
    <p>Joseph‚Äôs case is not an isolated incident. Across the country, people‚Äîespecially those without resources‚Äîface harsh sentences, biased judges, and plea deals that punish rather than rehabilitate. By standing with Joseph, you‚Äôre standing for fairness, transparency, and the belief that everyone deserves a second chance.</p>

    <h2>The Full Story They Tried to Bury ‚Äî Joseph‚Äôs Words</h2>
    <button class="story-toggle" onclick="toggleStory()">Read Full Story</button>
    <div class="story-content" id="storyContent">
      <p>The ‚Äúplea‚Äù I took was really just a way for them to get me to cop out and avoid trial‚Äîa trial they probably knew they couldn‚Äôt win. They amended my original first-degree intentional attempted homicide charge (daunting, but shaky) into two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment. One count was already tacked on, plus a deadly weapon modifier. The exposure (their sales pitch) was supposedly cut in half if I accepted the plea.</p>
      <p>They made sure I ‚Äúknowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently‚Äù took the plea by going through the standard questionnaire in court, but I was a little misled by my public defender. Honestly, I was ill-informed. They gave me two and a half years under the maximum, so legally not excessive‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt mean it was fair.</p>
      <p>McGuire, the prosecutor for the state? Didn‚Äôt ring a bell. The real DA on my felony case was Denis John Stingl, who made an unofficial offer of ‚Äúfive in, five out.‚Äù When I asked my lawyer to get it in writing, he said the DA had mixed up the cases, so no deal.</p>
      <p>The plea was presented to me as-is by my attorney and in court with an initialed questionnaire clarified on record. I wasn‚Äôt at any off-the-record meetings and didn‚Äôt hear about any, except for one mishap. All I have are transcripts, police reports, and official stuff.</p>
      <p>I‚Äôm not innocent, though. Not in the saintly sense. I messed up. But this fight isn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about fairness. I needed a wake-up call, and this system gave me one in the worst way possible.</p>
      <h3>What Happened That Day</h3>
      <p>January 18, 2018: I was arguing with my then-girlfriend, Mekayla Terrell. We were living in a motel room. I was high, stressed, and spiraling. I pointed a gun at myself and told her I‚Äôd shoot. I didn't threaten her, I didn‚Äôt chase her, and I didn‚Äôt shoot <em>at</em> anyone. But the gun did go off‚Äîinto the floor‚Äîwhen I slammed it down. That‚Äôs the truth. She ran. I left. No one was hurt.</p>
      <p>I hid the gun because I panicked. I didn‚Äôt want her or her dad finding it. I didn‚Äôt leave it to threaten anyone. When the police came, I cooperated. I never ran, never fought, never tried to use the gun on them. The DA built their case on fear and assumptions‚Äînone of it backed by actual evidence.</p>
      <h3>The Courtroom and Sentencing</h3>
      <p>The judge who sentenced me treated me like a monster. Like every mistake I‚Äôd ever made was part of this one case. Here‚Äôs what they didn‚Äôt care about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No one testified. No victim showed up in court.</li>
        <li>They used unrelated accusations from my past to paint me as violent.</li>
        <li>The gun wasn‚Äôt fired at anyone. The only shot was into the floor.</li>
        <li>No physical injuries. No physical threats to law enforcement.</li>
        <li>I had no prior violent felonies‚Äîjust one misdemeanor from years ago.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They sentenced me as if I‚Äôd shot someone. But they knew they couldn‚Äôt prove that. That‚Äôs why they dropped the most serious charge and gave me this Frankenstein-plea instead.</p>
      <h3>Joseph‚Äôs Takeaway</h3>
      <p>This wasn‚Äôt just about one night or one mistake. It was about power. They wanted to win‚Äîwanted a conviction. They made me choose between risking 60 years at trial or taking their twisted deal. So I took it. Not because I was guilty of what they said‚Äîbecause I was scared. I had no support. My lawyer didn‚Äôt fight for me. And once I signed, the truth didn‚Äôt matter anymore.</p>
      <p>I‚Äôm not asking anyone to pretend I‚Äôm perfect. But I‚Äôm asking you to look at the facts. The truth matters. My sentence doesn‚Äôt match the evidence‚Äîor the law. And if this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone.</p>
      <p>But I‚Äôm still here. Still fighting. Scars and all.</p>
