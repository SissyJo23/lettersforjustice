      <h2>The Night That Changed Everything</h2>
      <p>On January 18, 2018, Joseph Lagerman’s life was changed forever. What began as an argument with his then-girlfriend, MT, became a night that would be used against him in ways he never imagined.</p>
      <p><strong>Instead of us telling you what happened, here are Joseph’s own words:</strong></p>

      <p><em>January eighteenth, twenty eighteen: spent arguing with my former girlfriend (MT it says in the papers)...</em></p>

      <p>...We proceeded to drink it (I also continued to do cocaine which somehow magically keeps your drunkness at bay even if you're not a big drinker). Escalated from a shouting match to a real life whack a mole game. We started taking turns breaking everything in the house, which wasn't much—we just moved in, and I was working on getting the place together.</p>

      <p>...I open the front door and see MT with two figures walking up to her and thought for some reason it was a good idea to pull my gun and tell these people to get away from my house and MT to come back inside. They left. She came back in.</p>

      <p>Our argument was mostly dead. But these people called the police telling them what happened—but added that I had dragged MT in the house and some other crazy stuff. A little while goes by and I see a cop—then many cops—surrounding the house. MT tells me so. I tell her “whatever you do, don't open up, give me a minute.” She says, “I'm letting them in,” and I run to the bathroom.</p>

      <p>I panicked... part of me didn’t care what happened next. I reached my arm out and blindly fired the two rounds I had. For some blessed reason I had three slugs in my gun—one I accidentally mis-chambered and dropped to the floor when I went out on the front porch.</p>

      <p>That leaves two. The shots struck the door jamb about 4 feet up from the floor, a few inches apart. Forty-five degrees to the side, the cops were coming in. They saw I was empty-handed and crying, and they dragged me away. In the squad car I asked if they hurt my dog and said other stuff, but I expressed being glad I hadn’t hurt anyone.</p>

      <p>...Also I cannot neglect the fact that a month or so before this incident I was arrested and awaiting court for a misdemeanor... They gave me four misdemeanors and about three days in jail even though I was unemployed and would have benefited from the six months of thinking time they eventually ran consecutive to the bigger sentence.</p>

      <p>In sentencing, the involved officers came in with their best long faces and traumatic stories, complete with dramatic pauses and a request that I be incarcerated for the length of their careers—and the judge said, “granted.”</p>

      <p>Oh yeah—they put some words in my mouth in an unofficial interview where I apparently admitted guilt to attempted murder.</p>

      <p>...McGuire didn’t ring a bell at all, so I checked my papers. He sat in on two reschedulings for my misdemeanor case. A man named Denis John Stingl was the DA on my felony case. The idiot made an unofficial offer of five-in-five-out, and when I told my lawyer to get it in writing, he said he had his cases mixed up (and the severity of mine), so no deal.</p>

      <p>The plea was presented to me the same from my attorney and in court, with an initialed questionnaire that was clarified on the record. It was to amend the charges like I said, and to leave both sides free to argue a sentence...</p>

      <p>I remember the judge had bobbleheads on his desk; Yoda on his and the D.A.'s side, and Darth Vader on the defendant's side. He said, “Yeah, people are going to commit suicide, but why involve somebody else?” I mean, he is right about that.</p>

      <p>The judge talked a lot about the example he had to set because of the three fallen officers... and mentioned another case he had where the officer was asking for lenience—and he disregarded it.</p>
