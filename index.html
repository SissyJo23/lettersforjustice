      <p>[ On January 18, 2018, Joseph Lagerman’s life was changed forever.
What began as an argument with his then-girlfriend, MT, became a night that would be used against him in ways he never imagined.
Instead of us telling you what happened, here are Joseph’s own words:

January eighteenth, twenty eighteen: spent arguing with my former girlfriend (MT it says in the papers) I found a half-filled huge bottle of Paul Masson (cheap brown liquor) in a backpack left by one of my friends in a backpack filled. We proceeded to drink it (I also continued to do cocaine which somehow magically keeps your drunkness at bay even if you're not a big drinker). Escalated from a shouting match to a real life whack a mole game. We started taking turns breaking everything in the house, which wasn't much we just moved in, and I was working on getting the place together. 
Anyways at one point I realize how drunk MT really is when she walks right past me with some bludgeon-able object and says out loud,"Where you at bitch?" Then walks outside on the porch looking for me...mind you its January in Wisconsin; definitely freezing, she's got on leggings and a bra. I close the door and lock it and she goes to the picture window raving about breaking it. I decide now that its kinda quiet go to the bathroom to do more cocaine ..a minute or two later I open the front door and see MT with two figures walking up to her and thought for some reason it was a good idea to pull my gun and tell these people to get away from my house and MT to come back inside. They left she came back in.
 Our argument was mostly dead. But these people called the police telling them what happened but added that I had dragged MT in the house and some other crazy stuff. Anyways a little while goes by and I look out of the window and see a cop than many cops surrounding the house. MT tells me so, I tell her whatever you do don't open up give me a minute, she says I'm letting em in, and I run to the bathroom. I panic but at the same time had my mind made up that I was going to get them to kill me. I reached my arm out blindly fired the two rounds I had, for some blessed reason I had three slugs in my gun one of which I accidentally mischambered and dropped to the floor when I went out on front porch.
 That leaves two...so directly in front of the bathroom there is a a wall the skinny way that divides the kitchen and another bedroom either of which you can go through to get to the front door. It’s one of those the other bedroom has two doors. The shots struck the door jamb about 4 feet up from the floor a few inches apart. See for you to get where I was you had to go through the kitchen because the other way was blocked by a couch directly in front of me it a wall kitchen sink, and stove.
 Forty-five degrees to the side the cops were coming in and seen that I was empty handed and crying, and they dragged me away...in the squad I asked if they hurt my dog and other semi-insensitive stuff but expressed being glad that I hadn't hurt anyone
I know it didn't help my case that I didn't lawyer up right away , there were three people that passed that year and a half that I was in county, in the line of duty for the first time since the eighty's...also i cannot neglect the fact that a month or so before this incident I was arrested and awaiting court for misdemeanor actually they gave me four misdemeanors and about three days in jail even though I was unemployed and would have benefitted greatly from the six months of thinking time they eventually ran consecutive to the bigger sentence.
 In sentencing the involved officers came in with their best long faces and traumatic stories complete with dramatic pauses and a request that I be incarcerated for the length of their careers and the judge said granted
oh yeah, they put some words in my mouth in an unofficial interview where I apparently admitted guilt to attempted Murder. 
Honestly, your words and passion filled my eyes with tears. Thank you for the positivity you share, and for believing in me. I DEFINITELY don't want to discourage you from encouraging me (it's like aloe vera on burned skin) but I'm not innocent...You're right about the fight and grit. At one point I was just so ungrateful I needed some kind of wake-up call. Unfortunately, it came in this form...
McGuire didn't ring a bell at all, so I checked my papers, and he sat in on two rescheduling for my misdemeanor case. A man named Denis John Stingl was the DA on my felony case. The idiot made an unofficial offer of five in five out and when I told my lawyer to get it in writing, he said he had his cases mixed up (and the severity of mine), so no deal). ...the plea was presented to me the same from my Attorney and in court with an initialed questionnaire that was clarified on the record. It was to amend the charges like I said and to leave both sides free to argue a sentence...I'm pretty sure I wasn't at any off-the-record meetings and didn't hear of any proceedings except that mishap∆...and all I have is the transcripts and official police reports and stuff
I remember the judge had bobbleheads on his desk; Yoda on his and the D.A.'s side and Darth Vader on the defendant's side. He said "yeah people are going to commit suicide, but why involve somebody else" I mean he is right about that
The judge talked a lot about the example he had to set because of the three fallen officers and mentioned another case he had a year and a half before where the officer was actually asking for lenience and he disregarded]</p>
