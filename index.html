    <h2>The Story They Tried to Bury</h2>
    <p>
      The ‘plea’ I took was really just a forced decision, backed into a corner where I didn’t understand all the moving pieces. I wasn’t walked through my options; I wasn’t told what would really come with it. It was confusion, pressure, and fear rolled into one.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night—the night that everything in my life split apart—what happened wasn’t what the courtroom made it out to be. It wasn’t rage, it wasn’t some cold-blooded intent. It was fear, it was panic, it was me spiraling inside a storm I couldn’t control. I panicked and didn’t care what happened to me at that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      They say justice means truth coming out. But I watched as witnesses never even showed up, and still the weight of their words—never spoken in that courtroom—crushed down on me. They stacked everything together, every mistake, every charge, every shred of my past and present, and turned it into one giant cage I could never crawl out from under. I wasn’t sentenced for a single act; I was sentenced as if I was every bad headline they could ever pin on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth? No one was hurt. No one was ever meant to be hurt. But once a story gets twisted, once it’s easier for the system to paint you as the villain, they don’t stop to dig for what’s real. They bury it. And they buried me with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sit here now, years later, still stunned at how fast it all unraveled. I remember the silence of the courtroom, the way words hung heavy, the way my voice never seemed to matter no matter how I tried. I wasn’t seen as a man in crisis. I was reduced to a case number, to a line on a docket, to a sentence longer than some serve for taking a life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, I fight. Still, I write. Still, I refuse to let them silence me. This story—the full story—isn’t just about me. It’s about every person who’s ever been chewed up by a system that doesn’t stop to ask why, doesn’t slow down to see the person behind the paperwork. 
    </p>
    <p>
      They tried to bury my story. But truth has a way of clawing back to the surface. And I’m still here. Still fighting. Scars and all.
